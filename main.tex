\section{\label{sec-introduction}Introduction}

(Should talk about some very very basic backgrounds like the applications and why it is important.)


Neutrino flavor conversions in vacuum are described by linear Sch\"{o}dinger eqution where the vacuum Hamiltonian doesn't depend on the state of neutrino flavors. It leads to periodic oscillations in different flavors. However, neutrinos propagate in dense neutrino media demonstrate highly nonlinear flavor transformations due to forward scattering interactions where the Hamiltonian is determined by the flavor contents. This nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation can result in instabilities in neutrino flavor conversions. To investigate the complicated behavior of such nonlinear flavor conversions, linear stability analysis has been introduced \cite{Banerjee2011a,Raffelt2013}. Recent study by I. Izaguirre, G. Raffelt, and I. Tamborra showed that the dispersion relation gaps of the linearized equation of motion tell us the linear stability of neutrino flavor conversions \cite{Izaguirre2016a}. We will prove that neutrino flavor conversion instabilities is not exactly mapped to gaps in dispersion relation in some cases. In Sec. \ref{sec-dr}, we review linear stability analysis and dispersion relation based on references \onlinecite{Raffelt2013} and \onlinecite{Izaguirre2016a}.

(Introduce what are we gonna do in other sections when the paper is finished.)



\section{\label{sec-dr}Dispersion Relation of Neutrino Flavor Conversion}

We consider two-flavor scenario ($\nu_{\mathrm e}$ and $\nu_{\mathrm x}$) of neutrino oscillations. We also assume that all neutrinos and antineutrinos are emitted as electron flavor. The flavor evolution of neutrino ensemble depends on flavor density matrices of neutrinos $\rho$ and antineutrinos $\bar\rho$ with energy $E$, direction of velocity $\hat{\mathbf v}$,
\begin{equation}
\ii (\partial_t + \mathbf v\cdot \mathbf{\nabla}) \rho = \left[H, \rho_n \right],
\label{eqn-liouville-eqn}
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Hamiltonian for neutrino oscillations. In the context, Hamiltonian depends on three different contributions from vacuum oscillations $H_{\mathrm v}$, interactions with matter $H_{\mathrm m}$, and interactions with neutrinos themselves $H_{\nu\nu}$. In this work, we ignore vacuum and matter terms since the concentration is on fast neutrino oscillations, which would occur even without neutrino mass differences \cite{Chakraborty2016,Dasgupta2017}. In order to calculate the neutrino self-interaction term $H_{\nu\nu}$, the distribution of neutrinos (antineutrinos) $f_{\nu_{\mathrm e}(\bar \nu_{\mathrm e})}(\hat{\mathbf v}, E)$ and $f_{\nu_{\mathrm x}(\bar \nu_{\mathrm x})}(\hat{\mathbf v}, E)$ is required, where $E$ is the energy of neutrinos (antineutrinos). We have
\begin{equation}
H_{\nu\nu} = \sqrt{2} G_{\mathrm F} \iint \frac{\mathrm d \cos\theta' \mathrm d\phi'}{4\pi} v^\mu v'_\mu \int \frac{E'^2 \mathrm d E'}{2\pi^2} \left( (f_{\nu_{\mathrm e}}' - f_{\nu_{\mathrm x}}' )\rho' -  (f_{\bar\nu_{\mathrm e}}' - f_{\bar\nu_{\mathrm x}}' ) \bar\rho' \right),
\end{equation}
where $v^\mu = ( 1, \sin\theta\cos\phi, \sin\theta\sin\phi, \cos\theta )^{\mathrm T}$ is the four velocity of (anti)neutrinos in our spherical coordinate system. Without vacuum contribution, the equation of motion for antineutrinos has the same form \cite{Duan2010}.

We follow the same assumption in reference \onlinecite{Izaguirre2016a} that the the distribution of $\nu_x$ and $\bar\nu_x$ are the same, namely $ f_{\nu_{\mathrm x}}(\hat{\mathbf v},E)  - f_{\bar\nu_{\mathrm x}}(\hat{\mathbf v},E)=0$. In addition, we have the same definition of electron lepton number (ELN) of neutrinos travelling in direction $\hat{\mathbf v}$,
\begin{equation}
G(\hat{\mathbf v}) =  \sqrt{2}G_{\mathrm F} \int \frac{E'^2 \mathrm d E'}{2\pi^2} ( f_{\nu_{\mathrm e}}(\cos\theta',\phi',E')  - f_{\bar\nu_{\mathrm e}}(\cos\theta',\phi',E')  ).
\end{equation}
The ELN is useful in linear stability analysis where we assumed that $\epsilon$ is small and evolve in the form $\tilde\epsilon e^{-i(\Omega t - \mathbf K\cdot \mathbf x)}$. Thus the linearized equation of motion depends only on $G(\hat{\mathbf v})$ and $\hat{\mathbf v}$,
\begin{equation}
\ii(\partial_t + \hat{\mathbf v} \cdot \nabla) \epsilon
\end{equation}

Linear stability analysis of Eq. \eqref{eqn-liouville-eqn} for axial symmetric neutrino emission shows that
\begin{align}
&\det \left( \omega \mathrm{I} + \frac{1}{2}
\begin{pmatrix}
   I_0 & 0 & 0 & -I_1 \\
   0 & -\frac{1}{2} (I_0 - I_2) & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} (I_0 - I_2) & 0 \\
   I_1 & 0 & 0 & -I_2
\end{pmatrix}\right) \nonumber\\
&=0,
\label{eqn-det-polarization-tensor}
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
   I_m =\int_{-1}^{1} d u G(u) \frac{u^m}{1 -  \left(\lvert k\rvert /\omega\right) u }.
\end{equation}
where we define $u=\cos\theta$ \cite{Raffelt2013}. $\lvert k \rvert /\omega$ is defined as the refractive index $n$ of the flavor wave. For spectrum $G(u)$ without zero values, the forbidden region is given by $1 -  \left(\lvert k\rvert /\omega\right) u\leq 0$. Two categories of solutions were found, namely the multi-azimuthal angle (MAA) solution and multi-zenith angle (MZA) solution \cite{Raffelt2013}. The MAA solution is related to symmetry breaking in azimuthal angle only, which is determined by
\begin{equation}
   \omega = \frac{1}{4}(I_0 - I_2).
   \label{eqn-maa}
\end{equation}
The MZA solution is related to symmetry breaking in both azimuthal angle and zenith angle, which is
\begin{equation}
\omega = - \frac{1}{4} \left( I_0 - I_2 \pm \sqrt{ (I_0 + I_2 - 2 I_1) (I_0 + I_2 + 2 I_1) } \right).
\label{eqn-mza}
\end{equation}
We denote the solution associated with $+$ sign as MZA+, while the solution assocated with $-$ sign as MZA-. The two solutions are connected to each other in dispersion relations. In general, it doesn't provide physical insights to distingush the two branches of solutions since they are simply two branches of the solution.

Eq. \eqref{eqn-det-polarization-tensor} is equivalent to dispersion relation defined in reference \onlinecite{Izaguirre2016a}. In other words, the solutions \eqref{eqn-maa} and \eqref{eqn-mza} are dispersion relations $D(\omega,\mathbf k)$ for a chosen direction of $\hat{\mathbf k} = \hat{\mathbf z}$.

\section{\label{sec-instabilities-and-gaps}Instabilities and Gaps}

In reference \onlinecite{Izaguirre2016a}, the authors relate gaps in dispersion relation to instabilities of neutrino oscillations. The definition of dispersion relation gaps becomes clear in axial symmetric emission examples. We repeat the two zenith angles case discussed in reference \onlinecite{Izaguirre2016a} as a review.

We continue the discussion of axial symmetric neutrino emissions but with discretized zenith angles $\theta$ thus discretized $u$. Hence the ELN is independent of azimuth angle $\phi$. For neutrino emission with $2$ zenith angles, the ELN spectrum can be written as
\begin{equation}
G(u)= \sum_{i=1}^2 g_i \delta(u - u_i).
\end{equation}

The MAA solution becomes an equation of hypobola for $\omega$ and $k$, which has asymptotes $\omega = k u_i$ for $i=1,2$. Meanwhile, hyperbola equation has two solutions of $\omega$ ($k$) for any given real $k$ ($\omega$). The solutions are either real which indicates stable solutions or complex which indicates exponential growth in linear regime. On the other hand, non-existance of real solutions of $\omega$ ($k$) for given real $k$ ($\omega$) is equivalent to gap in dispersion relation. Thus the equivalence of gap and instabilities is guaranteed in neutrino emission with two-zenith-angle emission. Fig. \ref{fig-dr-db} is a reproduction of Fig. 1 in reference \onlinecite{Izaguirre2016a}. The dispersion relation is shown as black lines. To plot the complex $\omega$, we define two quanties out of $\omega$, the real part $\omega_{\mathrm R}$ and $\omega_{\mathrm R}\pm \omega_{\mathrm I}$ as a combination of real part $\omega_{\mathrm R}$ and imaginary part $\omega_{\mathrm I}$. The real part $\omega_{\mathrm R}$ is shown as red solid lines and $\omega_{\mathrm R}\pm \omega_{\mathrm I}$ are shown as red dashed lines.

\label{fig-dr-db}
\end{figure}


However, this conclusion can not be generalized to arbitrary number of emission angles. As an example, we perform linear stability analysis of the three zenith angles emission configuration which is determined by a cubic function both in $\omega$ and $k$. Thus three solutions of $k$ ($\omega$) for given real $\omega$ ($k$) are epxected. As long as real solutions disappear, complex solutions emerge, which leads to instabilities occur even without an actual gap. As an example, we fix $\omega= 0.5$ for MAA solution (Fig. \ref{fig-dr-db} lower left panel). The three solutions of $k$ are $k=-4.6, 0.29, 1.2$.  $0.2$ which are all real and indicates no spatial instabilities. However, for another real $\omega = 0.2$, we find only one real solution $k=0.4$ from dispersion relation. The other solutions are complex and proven to be $k = -0.557106\pm 0.966535\mathrm i$ where the value with positive imaginary part leads to exponential growth. This gap and instability inconsistancy also exists in continuous angular distribution of neutrino emission.



In core collapse supernova, neutrino emission is not in discrete zenith angles. More realistic models involves continuous zenith angle ELN spectra. In the earlier works of fast modes, Sawyer analyzed a box shaped angular distribution of neutrino emission \cite{Sawyer2016}. To address the fact that instability does not always show up in dispersion relation as gap, we show that the relation between instability and gap in dispersion relation can break down for box spectrum with crossing.



We construct a box spectrum with value $-0.1$ within $u\in [-1,-0.3)$ and value $1$ within $[-0.3,1]$ as shown in the top left panel of Fig. \ref{fig-box-c1}. With the spectrum defined, we calculate the dispersion relation and find out complex values of $k$ for real $\omega$. The results show that both the MAA solution and MZA solutioins contain only one curve. No gap is formed but we observe instabilities, which are plotted as colored dots.

\section{\label{sec-gap-to-instability}From Gap to Instability}

In the situations that the ELN spectrum has no crossing, gap indeed indicates instabilities, as shown in \onlinecite{Izaguirre2016a}. In this section we prove that the instabilities in MAA, MZA+, or MZA- solution can only appear in either region $\omega\leq 0$ or region $\omega \geq 0$. As it suggests, the instability regions propagate only between the dispersion relation and the axis $\omega=0$. We reproduce the calculation in \onlinecite{Izaguirre2016a} using the same Garching core-collapse supernova data set \cite{garching-ccsn-data}. The spectrum shown in the left panel of Fig. \ref{fig-garching} is polynomial fitting of the Garching 1D supernova simulation data.

% \subsection{\label{sec-omega-to-zero}Instabilities at $\omega\to 0$}

For MAA solution of arbitrary spectrum, we write down the general form as
\begin{equation}
   4 = \bar I_0 - \bar I_2,
\end{equation}
where the $I_m$ is defined in the preceeding sections. Explicitly, we have to solve the integral function to find out $k$ for real $\omega$,
\begin{equation}
   k = \frac{1}{4} \int G(u) \frac{ 1 - u^2 }{ \omega/k - u }.
\end{equation}
For complex $k$, the integral can be decomposed into the principal value $\operatorname{Re}(k)$ and imaginary part $\operatorname{Im}(k)$ using Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem,
\begin{align}
\operatorname{Re}(k) =& \frac{1}{4}\left(  \mathcal{P} \int G(u) \frac{ 1 - u^2 }{  - u }  \right)\label{eqn-re-k-arbitrary-spectrum} \\
\operatorname{Im}(k) =&  \frac{\pi}{4}G(0) \operatorname{Sign}\left( \omega \right) \operatorname{Sign}\left(  \operatorname{Im}(k)  \right).
\label{eqn-im-k-arbitrary-spectrum}
\end{align}
We conclude from Eq. \eqref{eqn-im-k-arbitrary-spectrum} that $\omega$ has to have the same sign as $G(0)$. What's more, the value of $k$ at limit $\omega\to 0$ can be solved out of Eq. \eqref{eqn-re-k-arbitrary-spectrum} and Eq. \eqref{eqn-im-k-arbitrary-spectrum}. For instabilities the imaginary part of $k$ tells us the growth,
\begin{equation}
   \lvert \operatorname{Im}(k) \rvert  =  \frac{\pi}{4}\lvert G(0)\rvert .
\end{equation}
Similar result is obtained for MZA solutions,
\begin{align}
&\left(4\operatorname{Re}(k) - \mathcal P \int \frac{G(u)}{u} \mathrm d u + U_1 \right)^2  - \left( \operatorname{Sign}(\omega \operatorname{Im}(k) )\pi G(0) +4 \operatorname{Im}(k) \right)^2 \\
=&\left( \mathcal P \int \frac{G(u)}{u} \mathrm d u + U_1 \right)^2 -1 - 4 U_0^2  \\
&\left( 4 \operatorname{Re}(k) - \mathcal P \int \frac{G(u)}{u} \mathrm d u + U_1 \right) \left( \pi \operatorname{Sign}(\omega \operatorname{Im}(k) ) G(0) + 4 \operatorname{Im}(k) \right) \\
=& - \left( \mathcal P \int \frac{G(u)}{u} \mathrm du + U_1 \right) \pi \operatorname{Sign}(\omega \operatorname{Im}(k) ) G(0),
\end{align}
where $U_m = \int G(u) u^m \mathrm du$ and all the integrals are from $-1$ to $1$. The equations are quadratic in both $\operatorname{Re}(k)$ and $\operatorname{Im}(k)$ so the real solutions can be calculated and verified with linear stability analysis. The imaginary part $\operatorname{Im}(k)$
\begin{equation}
   \operatorname{Im}(k) = - \frac{1}{4} \pi G(0) \operatorname{Sign}(\omega k_I) \left(  1 + \frac{ \mathscr P \int \frac{G(u)}{u} du + \int G(u) u du }{ 4 \operatorname{Re}(k) - \mathscr P \int \frac{G(u)}{u} du + \int G(u) u du }  \right)
\end{equation}
determines that the two solutions are either in the region $\omega>0$ or in the region $\omega<0$ which corresponds to MZA+ and MZA- solutions.
