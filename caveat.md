1. Plug in all the data points from analytical calculations at omega=0, to make the plots better.
2. Put in the scales to the figures.
3. Is the fact that we can not generalize to multiple angles related to spurious oscillations?
4. The forbidden region for box spectrum is determined by the emission angles. But is the forbidden region worth mentioning here? I don't think so.
5. I could show the results for box C4 since it has both MAA and MZA instabilities. But we care about complex $k$ the most so I guess WC4 is fine.
6. Should I combine the MZA+ and MZA- solutions in box spectrum?
